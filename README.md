# Wolf Software Inno Setup Buildtools

Helps to build Inno-Setup installer packages on Azure Devops build pipelines.

For hints to use see [overview](./overview.md)



## To build the tools itself

### You need the following tools:

#### NodeJS

First, you need to install NodeJS. You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install NPM for you to work with. You can leave the default options in the wizard.

We have tested the build with version 16.13.0

#### TFX

By installing TFX, you are able to create a package out of your files. Create it by using the following command in a PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
npm install -g tfx-cli
```

### Build

```powershell
tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json
```

### Publish the task

All set, letâ€™s publish our custom Azure DevOps pipeline task for  PowerShell to the market place, so we can make it available in our  organizations.
In your browser, open the [Market place.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003674)
